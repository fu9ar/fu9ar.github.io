It was the moment where millions of douchebags collectively understood that those dick pics that they sent to women were always going to be in someone's dick database.

A college-aged woman accidentally e-mails you her private journal. What is the moral choice?

A paralyzed man wants to have VR sex.



How do we define boundaries so that they are clear in a mutual VR hallucination? What are the possible rules of DNI games?
