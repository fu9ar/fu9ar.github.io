title: Cybernetic Ethics: DNI And Privacy - Questions
---

Sharing of social data is a similar issue to future issues of sharing Direct Neural Interface(DNI) thoughts. Regardless of the thoughts that you may have, the impact that you have on the world separate from your body is not necessarily internal, even if that impact happens to be via a carnally interfaced computer. Intent is the key. We cannot compare them to something like a passive MRI or a CAT scan, because in those situations, the data is being collected from the passive subject, so there is no intent, but what about data that is impacted

What about the ethics of networked DNI?

How do we define boundaries so that they are clear in a mutual VR hallucination? What are the possible rules of DNI games?
